# 🧠 AI Agent Scheduler

An intelligent task scheduling system powered by AI agents. This project demonstrates how multiple agents can coordinate, prioritize, and schedule tasks automatically based on input instructions, deadlines, and resource availability.

## 🚀 Features
- 🤖 Intelligent AI agents for dynamic task assignment
- ⏱️ Auto-prioritization of tasks based on urgency and importance
- 📅 Smart scheduling algorithm that avoids conflicts
- 💬 Simple user interface for task input and execution view
- 🧩 Modular codebase for easy integration and upgrades

## 📦 Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
▶️ How to Run

Edit
python main.py --input data/sample_tasks.json
🛠️ Use Cases
Team workflow automation

Personal productivity agent

College project on multi-agent systems

AI-powered daily planners

🧪 Example
Give it a task list like:

json
Copy
Edit
[
  {"task": "Write report", "deadline": "2025-07-01", "priority": "High"},
  {"task": "Reply to emails", "deadline": "2025-07-03", "priority": "Low"}
]
The system will output a smart schedule and assign the tasks to suitable agents.

🧑‍💻 Developer Notes
The scheduler uses a rule-based + learning-based hybrid logic.

Agents communicate using custom-designed protocols.

This is a modular design and can be extended with NLP or speech input.

🏁 Final Note
This project is a demo/prototype — still being improved.
🔧 I'm working on better UI, agent communication, and integration with calendar APIs.
