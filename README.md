## 📦 Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
▶️ How to Run

🛠️ Use Cases
Team workflow automation

Personal productivity agent

College project on multi-agent systems

AI-powered daily planners

🧪 Example
Give it a task list like:

json
Copy
Edit
[
  {"task": "Write report", "deadline": "2025-07-01", "priority": "High"},
  {"task": "Reply to emails", "deadline": "2025-07-03", "priority": "Low"}
]
The system will output a smart schedule and assign the tasks to suitable agents.

🧑‍💻 Developer Notes
The scheduler uses a rule-based + learning-based hybrid logic.

Agents communicate using custom-designed protocols.

This is a modular design and can be extended with NLP or speech input.

🏁 Final Note
This project is a demo/prototype — still being improved.
🔧 I'm working on better UI, agent communication, and integration with calendar APIs.
